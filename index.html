            <p>A web developer is a programmer responsible for turning user stories, mockups, and web designs into
                functional websites. They use web fundamentals such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build, manage, and
                deploy web applications. Web developers might also use a variety of programming languages depending on
                your website's technology stack, including Python, PHP, and Ruby. A web developer must also ensure that
                the website is compatible with all devices and browsers. </p>

                he hero can have many attributes. Some of them can be to be the oldest team member, carry a lot of
                specific domain knowledge, have a weaker programming skill, avoid certain meetings or work long hours.
                One thing in common is that they are always seen by other people as "saviors" while doing a bad job.
